**What is Node.js and why would you use it?**

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It was built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and it allows developers to build fast, scalable network applications. Node.js is event-driven, which means that it can handle a large number of connections with minimal resources. It is particularly useful for building real-time web applications, such as chat applications, gaming platforms, or collaborative tools.

**How does Node.js handle asynchronous I/O?**

Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven architecture to handle asynchronous I/O. Instead of creating a new thread for every incoming request, Node.js uses an event loop to manage incoming requests and responses. When a request comes in, Node.js adds it to the event loop, which then processes the request asynchronously. When the response is ready, Node.js sends it back to the client.

**What is event-driven programming in Node.js?**

Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm that allows developers to write code that responds to specific events or signals. In Node.js, event-driven programming is used to handle asynchronous I/O. When an event occurs, such as an incoming request or a completed database query, Node.js uses an event emitter to notify the rest of the application. The application can then respond to the event by executing a callback function or emitting its own events.

**What is callback hell and how do you avoid it in Node.js?**

Callback hell is a term used to describe the situation where callback functions are nested several levels deep, making the code difficult to read and maintain. This can happen in Node.js applications that rely heavily on asynchronous I/O. To avoid callback hell, developers can use techniques such as promises, async/await, or the use of libraries like async.js. These techniques can simplify the code and make it more readable.

**What is the difference between require and import statements in Node.js?**

In Node.js, the require statement is used to load a module, while the import statement is used in ES6 modules to import functionality from other modules. The require statement is a CommonJS module system, which is a module system used in Node.js, while the import statement is a new syntax for loading modules introduced in ES6.

**How do you handle errors in Node.js?**

In Node.js, errors can be handled using try/catch blocks or by passing errors as the first argument in a callback function. Developers can also use the error event to handle errors that occur in event emitters. It is important to handle errors appropriately in Node.js applications to prevent crashes and ensure proper error reporting.

**What is middleware in Node.js and how do you use it?**

Middleware is a function that sits between the server and the application logic, processing requests and responses. In Node.js, middleware can be used to handle authentication, logging, caching, or other functions that need to be applied to multiple routes or endpoints. Middleware is typically used in conjunction with the Express framework, and it can be added to a route using the use() method.

**How do you handle authentication in a Node.js application?**

In a Node.js application, authentication can be handled using techniques such as cookies, JSON Web Tokens (JWT), or OAuth. Authentication middleware can be added to routes to ensure that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the application. It is important to store passwords securely using techniques such as hashing and salting to prevent data breaches.

**What is the purpose of the process object in Node.js?**

The process object is a global object in Node.js that provides information about the current Node.js process, as well as methods to interact with it. It can be used to access environment variables, command line arguments, and other information about the running process. The process object also has methods for exiting the process, setting up signal handlers, and sending messages between processes.

**What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js?**

Synchronous programming is a programming model where each operation blocks the execution until it completes. Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows multiple operations to be executed simultaneously without blocking the execution of the program. In Node.js, asynchronous programming is used extensively to handle I/O operations, which can be time-consuming and block the event loop if executed synchronously.

**How does Node.js handle multi-threading?**

Node.js is single-threaded, which means that it can only execute one task at a time. However, Node.js can handle multiple requests simultaneously by using an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O model. In addition, Node.js can take advantage of multi-core CPUs by using the cluster module, which allows developers to create child processes to handle incoming requests.

**What is the difference between a buffer and a stream in Node.js?**

A buffer is a temporary storage area in memory that holds data while it is being transferred between two endpoints. A stream, on the other hand, is a continuous flow of data that is processed in chunks as it is received. In Node.js, buffers are used to store binary data, such as images or video, while streams are used to transfer data between different parts of an application or between a server and a client.

**What is the difference between setTimeout and setImmediate in Node.js?**

setTimeout and setImmediate are both used to schedule code to be executed at a later time. However, setTimeout schedules the code to be executed after a certain amount of time has passed, while setImmediate schedules the code to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop. This means that setImmediate can be used to execute code immediately after the current code block has completed, without waiting for the next event loop iteration.

**How do you handle file uploads in a Node.js application?**

In a Node.js application, file uploads can be handled using middleware such as multer. Multer is a middleware that allows developers to handle file uploads in multiple formats, such as binary data or multipart/form-data. The middleware can be used to handle file uploads for single or multiple files, and it can be configured to limit the size or type of the files that can be uploaded.

**What is clustering in Node.js?**

Clustering is a technique used in Node.js to take advantage of multi-core CPUs. It allows developers to create child processes that can handle incoming requests, spreading the load across multiple CPUs. Clustering can be implemented using the cluster module, which allows developers to create a master process that spawns multiple worker processes to handle requests.

**What is the purpose of the util module in Node.js?**

The util module is a built-in module in Node.js that provides a set of utility functions that can be used to perform common tasks, such as formatting strings, logging, and working with objects. The util module also provides a set of functions for working with streams, buffers, and events.

**What is the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate in Node.js?**

process.nextTick and setImmediate are both used to schedule code to be executed in the next iteration of the event loop. However, process.nextTick schedules the code to be executed before any I/O operations,
while setImmediate schedules the code to be executed after any I/O operations. This means that process.nextTick is used to execute code as soon as possible, even if it means delaying I/O operations, while setImmediate is used to execute code after any I/O operations have completed.

**How do you handle errors in Node.js?**

In Node.js, errors can be handled using try-catch blocks or by attaching an error event listener to an object that emits events. Errors that occur during asynchronous operations can be handled using callbacks or promises. Node.js also provides a global process.on('uncaughtException') event listener that can be used to catch unhandled exceptions.
