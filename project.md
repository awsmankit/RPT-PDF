**1. Can you explain your C-DAC project? Draw block diagram as appropriate.**

My CDAC project is train reservation system, it is a web application that allows users to search train for available routes and make reservations for multiple passengers. The application was built using Spring Boot for the back-end, MySQL for the database, and React.js for the front-end. The application also features user authentication and uses JWT tokens for secure communication.

Here's an example block diagram for the system:

                                +--------------------------+
                                |     React Frontend       |
                                +--------------------------+
                                           |
                                           |
                                           |
                                           |
                                +--------------------------+
                                |    Spring Boot Backend   |
                                +--------------------------+
                                           |
                             +-----------------------------+
                             |             API             |
                             +-----------------------------+
                                           |
                             +-----------------------------+
                             |         Data Access         |
                             +-----------------------------+
                                           |
                             +-----------------------------+
                             |         Database            |
                             +-----------------------------+

In this diagram, the React frontend communicates with the Spring Boot backend through a RESTful API. The backend is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, processing the data, and providing the required responses. It interacts with the database through data access objects, which abstract the underlying data storage implementation.

The Spring Boot backend is responsible for the core business logic of the train reservation system, which includes tasks such as handling train availability, making reservations, and managing payment transactions. The React frontend is responsible for presenting the data to the user and enabling them to interact with the system.

This block diagram provides a high-level overview of the architecture of the train reservation system, but keep in mind that the actual implementation details may vary depending on the specific requirements of the system.

The system uses JWT tokens for authentication and features various modules such as reservation, train info, user info, search, payment, and availability. The application is designed to be scalable, secure, and user-friendly.

**2. What's new in your project?**

As a fresher candidate, I don't have any previous project experience.
However I can mention some unique features that set it apart from similar projects:

**Secure Authentication:** The project uses JWT tokens for user authentication, which ensures secure communication between the client and server.

**Availability Module:** The project has a dedicated module that allows users to check the availability of seats on specific train routes. This feature is useful for users who want to plan their travel in advance.

**Payment Integration:** our project has a payment module that allows users to make payments securely for their reservations.
We have tried to integrate the payment gateway with the project, making it easy for users to complete their transactions.

**User-friendly Interface:** Our project has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to search for train routes, view train schedules, and make reservations. The interface is intuitive and easy to use, even for users who are not tech-savvy.

**3. Explain why did you select this technology & framework for this project?**

Firstly, I chose Spring Boot as the back-end framework because it is a java based web application
-lightweight,
-easy to use,
-it provides many features like security, data access and
-it reduces boiler plate code.
-it has Dependency management which ensure that your project has all the latest needed libraries at one place.

Secondly, I chose MySQL as the database for the project because it is a popular, open-source RDBMS (relational database) that is easy to use and can handle large amounts of data efficiently. It can be easily integrated with Spring Boot.

Finally, I chose React.js as the front-end framework because it is a popular, high-performance JavaScript library that allows for the creation of dynamic, interactive user interfaces. React.js has a large community and various libraries and tools, making it easy to develop complex front-end features.

4. Explain how OOPs concepts are implemented in your project?

In my train reservation system project, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts are implemented in the following ways:

**Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the technique of hiding internal details of an object from the outside world.
In my project, encapsulation is achieved by using _private access modifiers_ for class members wherever appropriate.
For example, the User class has private fields for storing user data such as name, email, and password, and these fields are accessed and modified through public getter and setter methods.

**Inheritance:** Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit properties and behaviors from its parent class.
The User class is the parent class, and the Admin and Customer classes are the child classes. The Admin class and Customer class inherit all the properties and behaviors of the User class, such as the name, email, and password.

**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on many forms. In my project, polymorphism is implemented through method overriding.
For example, the toString() method of the Train class is overridden in the Booking class to display additional reservation information such as the seat number and passenger name.
Another example The Payment interface defines the abstract method pay(), which is implemented by each payment provider class, such as PayPal and CreditCard. Each payment provider class has its own implementation of the pay() method, which allows for flexible and extensible payment processing.

**Abstraction:** Abstraction is the process of hiding complex details and showing only the essential features of an object.
In my project, abstraction is achieved through interfaces.
for example Use of the Repository interface in the data access layer. The Repository interface defines the abstract methods for interacting with the database, such as adding, updating, and deleting records. The actual implementation of these methods is provided by specific repository classes such as TrainRepository and ReservationRepository.

**5. Draw use-case diagram, Class diagram and ER diagrams Of your project?**

Use-case diagram:
The use-case diagram for the train reservation system project outlines the different user roles and the actions they can perform in the system. The main actors in the system are the admin, customer, and guest users. The admin user can perform actions such as adding and updating trains, viewing and editing user profiles, and managing reservations. The customer user can search for trains, make reservations, and view their reservation history. The guest user can only search for trains and view their schedules.

Class diagram:
The class diagram for the train reservation system project shows the different classes in the system and their relationships. The main classes in the system are User, Train, Reservation, Payment, and Schedule. The User class has two child classes, Admin and Customer. The Train class has a one-to-many relationship with the Reservation class, and the Reservation class has a many-to-one relationship with the User and Train classes. The Payment class has a many-to-one relationship with the Reservation class, and the Schedule class has a one-to-many relationship with the Train class.

ER diagrams:
The ER diagrams for the train reservation system project show the relationships between the entities in the system. The main entities in the system are User, Train, Reservation, Payment, and Schedule. The User entity has attributes such as name, email, and password. The Train entity has attributes such as train number, source, destination, and departure time. The Reservation entity has attributes such as seat number and passenger name. The Payment entity has attributes such as payment ID and amount. The Schedule entity has attributes such as schedule ID and arrival time. The relationships between these entities are shown using cardinality notation, such as one-to-many and many-to-one.

**6. Explain n-tier architecture of your project?**

The n-tier architecture of the train reservation system project consists of three main tiers: presentation tier, application tier, and data tier.

**Presentation Tier:** The presentation tier is the topmost tier of the architecture, which is responsible for presenting the user interface to the end-users. In our project, the presentation tier is implemented using React.js. The React.js components are responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user events, and sending requests to the application tier.

**Application Tier:** The application tier is the middle tier of the architecture, which contains the business logic and processes the requests from the presentation tier implemented using Spring Boot. The Spring Boot framework provides a robust and scalable platform for developing and deploying Java-based applications. The application tier includes various modules such as authentication, payment processing, train management, Booking management, and user management.

**Data Tier:** The data tier is the bottommost tier of the architecture, which is responsible for storing and retrieving data from the underlying database that is MySQL. The MySQL database stores all the data related to the train schedules, user profiles, reservations, and payment transactions.

The n-tier architecture provides several benefits such as scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. By separating the presentation, application, and data tiers, we can easily add or remove functionality, modify the business logic, and scale the system as per the changing requirements. The n-tier architecture also improves the security of the system by enforcing data access control and preventing unauthorized access to the sensitive data

**7. Which advanced features have you used in your project ?**

**Authentication and Authorization:** Authentication and authorization are important features to ensure that only authorized users have access to the system. In our project, authentication and authorization are implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Spring Security.

Dummy Payment Gateway Integration: Payment gateway integration is an advanced feature that allows users to pay for their reservations securely. In our project, payment gateway integration is implemented using Stripe, which is a popular payment gateway service.

_Real-Time Notifications: Real-time notifications are a useful feature that keeps users informed about their reservation status and any changes to the train schedule. In our project, real-time notifications are implemented using web sockets and React.js._

**Caching:** Caching is an advanced feature that can improve the performance of the system by reducing the number of database queries. In our project, caching is implemented using the Spring Cache abstraction.

**Error Logging and Monitoring:** Error logging and monitoring are important features that help developers to identify and fix issues in the system. In our project, error logging and monitoring are implemented using Spring AOP and Log4j.

**8.What was your role in your project and explain what you did in it?**

I was involved in **understanding the project requirements and specifications** decided between team members. I also participated in discussions to clarify the requirements and ensure that the project was on track.

Based on the requirements, I helped in **designing the system architecture and designing the database schema**. I also worked on implementing the frontend and backend components of the system using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Spring Boot, and MySQL.

I was involved in **testing the application** by creating test cases and conducting unit testing. I also worked on debugging the issues that arose during the testing phase and ensuring that the application was error-free.

I was responsible for creating the technical **documentation for the project**, which included the project architecture, code documentation, and user manuals.
]
Overall, my role in the project was to contribute as a developer and work collaboratively with other team members to ensure that the project was delivered on time and met the required specifications.

**9. Which software development methodology(model/architecture) you have used in project? Explain its process.**

we followed the Agile methodology.

_The Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer satisfaction._

which included :

**Requirements Gathering** where the product backlog is created. which contains a list of features and requirements that need to be implemented.

**Sprint Planning** where we listed the tasks that need to be completed during the sprint.

**Sprint Execution** where the team works on implementing the requirements from the sprint backlog and identify any issues that need to be addressed.

**Sprint Retrospective** where the team reflects on the completed project and identifies areas for improvement.

**10. How will you deploy your project (on web server/client machine)?**

We are thinking to deploy our project on AWS with EC2 instance

**firstly we create an EC2 instance on AWS:** You can create an EC2 instance on AWS by logging into the AWS Management Console, navigating to the EC2 dashboard, and launching a new instance. You will need to choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) -- we chose linux, select an instance type, configure security settings, and create a key pair to access your instance.

**Then we install necessary software:** Once your EC2 instance is up and running, you need to install the necessary software to run your project. This includes installing Java, Node.js, and MySQL on your EC2 instance.

**Copy your project files to your EC2 instance:** You can copy your project files to your EC2 instance using tools like SCP or SFTP.

**Build and package your project:** You need to build and package your project into a deployable format, such as a JAR or WAR file, for Spring Boot, and a static build for React.

**Run your project:** Once your project is built and packaged, you can run it on your EC2 instance. You will need to start the Spring Boot server, set up the MySQL database, and start the React frontend.

**Configure your security group:** You need to configure your security group to allow inbound traffic to your EC2 instance. You can open specific ports for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH access.

**Access your project:** Once your project is running on your EC2 instance, you can access it by opening a web browser and entering the public IP address or DNS name of your EC2 instance.

**11. Which Design pattern are used in your project?**

In our project, we have used several design patterns to ensure that the code is modular, flexible, and easy to maintain. Here are some of the design patterns that we have used in our project:

**Model-View-Controller (MVC):** We have used the MVC pattern to separate the application's concerns into three distinct components: the Model, View, and Controller. The Model represents the data and the business logic, the View represents the user interface, and the Controller manages the flow of data between the Model and View.

**Singleton:** We have used the Singleton pattern to ensure that certain objects, such as the database connection object, are created only once and reused throughout the application.

**Dependency Injection:** We have used Dependency Injection to provide a way to inject dependencies into objects at runtime. This pattern allows for greater flexibility and decoupling of objects. You can use this pattern to manage the dependencies between the Spring Boot components in your project, such as Controllers, Services, and Repositories.

**Repository Pattern:** In this pattern, the data access logic is separated from the business logic, and the data is accessed through a set of repository interfaces. You can use this pattern to design the data access layer of your project, where Spring Data JPA can be used as the implementation for the Repository interfaces, and MySQL can be used as the data store.

**12. What are the limitations of your project?**

Here are some of the limitations of our project:

**Limited Scalability:** Our project was designed for a small to medium-sized train reservation system. If we were to scale the project to handle a large number of users, it may require additional hardware and software resources to ensure that it can handle the increased load.

**Limited Security:** While we implemented authentication and authorization in our project, there may still be vulnerabilities that could be exploited by hackers. Therefore, it is important to regularly update the security measures to ensure that the system is protected against potential security threats.

**Limited Testing:** Due to the limited time and resources, we were not able to test the project as thoroughly as we would have liked. This means that there may be some undiscovered bugs or issues that could impact the system's performance.

**Limited Compatibility:** Our project was built using specific technologies and frameworks, such as Spring Boot and React.js. This means that the project may not be compatible with older versions of browsers or other technologies.

**13. What are the difficulties you have faced during this project and How you have overcome it?**

Here are some of the difficulties we faced and how we overcame them:

**Technical challenges:** We faced several technical challenges, such as integrating different technologies and frameworks. To overcome these challenges, we researched and studied the documentation and examples provided by the technologies and frameworks. We also sought help from our professors and online communities to get feedback and assistance.

**Time management:** As students, we had to balance our coursework and other responsibilities with the project. To overcome this challenge, we created a schedule and set realistic goals and deadlines for each stage of the project. We also communicated regularly with each other to ensure that we were on track and to identify and address any issues that arose.

**Communication issues:** There were times when we faced communication issues, such as misunderstandings or miscommunications between team members. To overcome this challenge, we established clear communication channels and protocols. We also made sure to listen actively to each other and to clarify any misunderstandings.

**Lack of experience:** As students, we had limited experience working on large-scale projects. To overcome this challenge, we sought guidance and mentorship from our professors and industry professionals. We also researched and studied best practices and techniques for project management and software development.

**14. How will you improve the performance Of your project? (memory related and response time) ?**

To improve the performance of a project, there are several strategies that can be used, particularly in the areas of memory utilization and response time. Here are some possible approaches that could be taken:

**Implement caching:** Caching is a technique that can improve response time and reduce the load on the server by storing frequently accessed data in memory. By implementing caching, the project can serve data faster and with less resource utilization.

**Optimize database queries:** Database queries can be optimized by creating appropriate indexes and avoiding expensive queries that may require scanning large amounts of data. By optimizing queries, the project can reduce the response time and improve memory utilization.

**Use asynchronous programming:** Asynchronous programming can help to reduce the response time by allowing the system to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. This can be particularly useful for long-running or resource-intensive tasks.

**Monitor and analyze performance:** It is important to monitor the performance of the project regularly and to analyze the data to identify areas where performance can be improved. This can be done using tools such as profiling or monitoring software.

**15. Which database is used in your Project? Why? Explain database design.**

We used the MySQL database management system. We chose MySQL for several reasons, including its open-source license, popularity, and compatibility with the technologies we were using such as Spring Boot and React.js.

Our database design followed a relational model and consisted of several tables, including:

Users table: This table stored information about users, including their username, password, and contact information.

train table: This table stored information about the trains available for booking, including the train number, name, source, destination, and fare.

Reservation details table: This table stored information about the reservations made by users, including the reservation ID, train number, date of travel, number of seats booked, and the user who made the reservation.

Payment details table: This table stored information about the payments made by users, including the payment ID, amount paid, and the user who made the payment.

We used the Entity-Relationship (ER) model to design our database schema. The ER model allowed us to represent the relationships between entities and to define constraints and rules to ensure data integrity.
We also used normalization techniques to eliminate redundancy and improve data consistency.

In addition to designing the database schema, we also implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using SQL queries and integrated the database with our Spring Boot backend using the Spring Data JPA framework. This allowed us to perform database operations from our application code and ensured that the data stored in the database was consistent with the business logic of our application.

**16. Explain data flow diagrams?**

The train reservation system has different types of users, including the admin user and passenger user. The data flow for each type of user can be different, so I will explain them separately.

Data flow for Admin user:

The admin user logs in to the system using their credentials.

After successful authentication, the admin user can perform several tasks such as adding a new train, updating train details, viewing booking history, etc.

When the admin user adds a new train or updates the train details, the system stores the information in the MySQL database.

When a passenger makes a reservation, the system checks the availability of the selected train and seat.

If the seat is available, the system stores the reservation details in the MySQL database and updates the train seat availability accordingly.

Data flow for Passenger user:

The passenger user logs in to the system using their credentials.

After successful authentication, the passenger user can search for trains, select a train, choose a seat, and make a reservation.

When a passenger makes a reservation, the system checks the availability of the selected train and seat.

If the seat is available, the system stores the reservation details in the MySQL database and updates the train seat availability accordingly.

The passenger user can view their reservation history and cancel a reservation if needed.

**17. Explain data access layer of your database?**

In my project, The data access layer is implemented using Spring Data JPA. Spring Data JPA is a powerful and widely-used ORM framework that simplifies the development of data access layer by providing a higher level of abstraction.

With Spring Data JPA, the data access layer or DAO is implemented using interfaces that extend the JpaRepository interface.
These interfaces define the various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```java

public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {

    User findByEmail(String email);

}
```

In this example, the UserRepository interface extends the JpaRepository interface and defines a method called findByEmail. This method is used to retrieve a User object from the database based on their email address.

Under the hood, Spring Data JPA uses Hibernate as the underlying ORM framework. Hibernate translates the method signature into an appropriate SQL query and executes it against the database.

Overall, Spring Data JPA provides a simple and efficient way to implement the data access layer in a Spring Boot application.
It eliminates the need to write boilerplate code and reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop the data access layer.

**18. How to write stored procedure in your database? How to call from your data access layer?**

To create a stored procedure in SQL Server, you can use the CREATE PROCEDURE statement, followed by the SQL statements that make up the body of the procedure. For example, consider the following stored procedure that retrieves all users from a users table:

```mysql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllUsers
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM users;
END
```

Here is an example of calling the GetAllUsers stored procedure using SqlCommand:

```java
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();

    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("GetAllUsers", connection))
    {
        command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;

        using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())
        {
            while (reader.Read())
            {

            }
        }
    }
}
```

we first create a SqlConnection object and open a connection to the database using a connection string. We then create a SqlCommand object that represents the GetAllUsers stored procedure and set its CommandType property to CommandType.StoredProcedure. We then execute the stored procedure using the ExecuteReader method of SqlCommand and iterate over the results using a SqlDataReader.

**19. How many web pages are present in your project ? and in each module of your project?**

Home page - This may contain information about the train system and a call-to-action for the user to sign in or register.

Sign-in page - This is where the user can sign in with their credentials.

Registration page - This is where new users can register to use the system.

Admin dashboard - This is where the admin can manage the system and its various components.

Passenger dashboard - This is where the passenger can view their reservations, book new reservations, and manage their account settings.

Reservation page - This is where passengers can search for available trains, select their travel dates, and make a reservation.

Payment page - This is where passengers can make payments for their reservations.

Confirmation page - This is where passengers can view the details of their reservation after they have successfully completed the booking process.

**20. How did you implement look and feel of your web pages? Have you used any framework and why?**

Using a front-end framework such as **Bootstrap** can help to implement the look and feel of the web pages of a train reservation system.
These frameworks provide pre-built UI components and styles that can be customized to meet the project's requirements. By using a framework, we can save development time and create a consistent design across different web pages.

**21. Have you used AJAX in your project? How?**

AJAX stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**, and it is a technique used to update web page content without reloading the entire page.

If I were to use AJAX in the train reservation system project, I could use it to retrieve data from the server and update the web page dynamically, without requiring the user to navigate to a different page.

For example, I could use AJAX to update the availability of train seats when a passenger makes a reservation. When a passenger selects a train, date, and seat, an AJAX request can be sent to the server to check the availability of the selected seat. Based on the server's response, the web page can display a message indicating whether the seat is available or already booked.

**22. Explain configuration files used in your project?**

application.properties: This file is used to configure the application's properties such as the server port, database connection details, and logging settings.

application.yml: This file is an alternative to the application.properties file and is used to configure the application's settings in YAML format.

pom.xml: This file is used to manage the project's dependencies and build settings using Apache Maven.

**23. Explain security Of your project?**

To ensure the security of the system, the project may implement several security measures such as:

**JWT Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) can be used to authenticate users and authorize access to certain resources. JWT tokens can be issued by the server when a user logs in, and then passed to the client to be used for subsequent API requests.

**HTTPS:** The project may use HTTPS to encrypt the communication between the client and server, preventing unauthorized access and eavesdropping.

**Role-Based Access Control:** The system can define different roles such as admin and passenger and restrict access to certain resources based on the user's role.

**Input Validation:** The system should validate user input to prevent SQL injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

**Password Encryption:** The system should store passwords in encrypted form to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.
