**Can you explain how you implemented role-based permissions in the system? How did you ensure that only authorized users could access certain features and data?**

In our system, we used JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to handle authentication and authorization. Each user was assigned a specific role (admin, passenger, or agent) which determined their level of access to the system. We used Spring Security to enforce these permissions on the backend, and also implemented client-side routing in React to prevent unauthorized access to certain pages or components. Additionally, we used database constraints and validations to ensure that certain actions (such as deleting a reservation) could only be performed by users with the appropriate role and permissions.

**How did you handle errors and exceptions in the system? Did you use any specific logging or monitoring tools to track issues and diagnose problems?**

We used Spring Boot's built-in logging framework to track errors and exceptions in the backend, and also implemented Sentry.io for more detailed error reporting and analysis. In the frontend, we used React's error boundary component to catch and handle errors at the component level, and also implemented an error reporting system using Sentry.io and custom error handling components. We also used Postman and other testing tools to simulate various error scenarios and ensure that the system handled them gracefully.

**How did you measure the performance of the system? What metrics did you track and how did you analyze them to identify areas for improvement?**

We used a combination of tools to measure the performance of the system, including Spring Boot Actuator, JMeter, and browser developer tools. We tracked metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rate, and also used profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Based on these metrics and analyses, we implemented caching, indexing, and query tuning techniques to improve the system's performance.

**Can you provide an example of how you tested a specific feature or component of the system? What testing tools or frameworks did you use and how did you write the tests?**

For example, to test the reservation feature, we did unit testing. We used JUnit for unit testing, Spring Boot Test for integration testing, and Selenium and React Testing Library for end-to-end testing. We also used Postman and other API testing tools to verify the behavior of the backend API endpoints. Our test cases included scenarios such as creating a new reservation, modifying an existing reservation, and cancelling a reservation, and we used manual testing to ensure that all scenarios were covered.

**How did you ensure that the system was secure and compliant with relevant regulations and standards? Did you conduct any specific security or compliance audits or assessments?**

We followed industry best practices for security and compliance, including using HTTPS for secure communication, hashing and salting user passwords, and implementing access control measures to protect sensitive data.
